Hello everyone! This repository contains all the homework and assignments from Hacktiv8.
Currently, I am working on building my career in the data field starting from scratch.

In these files, I demonstrated proficiency in Python for data wrangling and cleaning with library Pandas.
I also have some experiences in making relational databases using PostgreSQL as well.

I believe that everything starts from a single baby step towards achieving the life that you want so,
I want to have to courage challenging myself becoming better.

Hope that these files can be an inspiration for practicing for you too.

Thank you for reading, all the best!!

Love, Catherine <3
